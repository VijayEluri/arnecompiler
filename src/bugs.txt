1
"alphanumeric123" gets parsed to an integer Word because it ends with a digit.

2 (fixed)	
"For" can not handle declarations: child.precompile should be able to precompile and replace the child itself, rather than only its children.

3 (fixed)
"Increment" and "Decrement" do not work because variable() and variable can not be distinguished

4 CRITICAL
Initializing variables after first use should really not be possible (or they should be actually initialized). Also the snippet: 

int d = read()
int a = 48
function read = ()->(
  a
)

uses unitialized variable a


5 (fixed)
Variable declaration with initializer does not work inside function body. Variable gets seen as static.

6
Function(f, ...);  f(); function(f, ...) resolves to the first function, not noticing the second one.

7
No detection of "symbol already defined"

8
No counting of number of arguments and types in builtin functions like IF

9
Iterative compilation is "too eager" to compile and makes mistakes like bug #6. Should be reworked a bit. fullyCompiled() is not yet used like it should.  

10 (fixed)
All integer operations seem to be unsigned, make them signed. Look out for integer division, use cdq for a sign extension of %eax to %edx.
